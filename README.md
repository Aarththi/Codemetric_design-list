Task 3 – Design To‑Do List Manager
Build a console app that:

Stores tasks using lists or dictionaries.

Persists data to a text file with Python file I/O.

Supports adding, deleting, displaying tasks.

Marks tasks as completed and persists those updates.

 Detailed Explanation
1. Persistent Storage
Loading: Checks if tasks.txt exists. Parses lines like "3 | Call Mom | Done" into task ID, description, and status.

Saving: Writes each task entry back with a pipe-separated format for easy parsing later.

2. Data Structure
Keeps tasks in a dictionary:

python
Copy
Edit
{1: {"task": "Finish report", "done": False}, ...}
IDs are used for easy reference and deletion.

3. Functionality
add_task(): Prompts and adds a new task with an incremented ID.

delete_task(): Removes a task by ID.

mark_completed(): Toggles the done flag.

display_tasks(): Shows all tasks sorted by ID, with status icons.

4. Console Interaction
A simple menu-driven loop handles user input (1–5).

After modifying tasks, the file is immediately saved, ensuring data integrity.

5. String Manipulation
Uses " | " as the delimiter for storing and reading task data.

Displays tasks with friendly icons and formats.

 What You Learn
File I/O basics: Reading/writing and handling missing files. 
geeksforgeeks.org

Data structures: Using dictionaries for organized storage.

String parsing: Splitting and formatting with delimiters.

Modular functions: Each feature in its own function.

User interaction: Building a console menu and input validation.

Persistent data: Saving changes immediately to prevent data loss.

This structure is inspired by classic CLI task manager designs and aligns well with beginner tutorials, combining clarity and functionality.
